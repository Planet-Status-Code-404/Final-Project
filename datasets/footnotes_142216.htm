													<li><p>Data are available for all states except Alaska and Hawaii.</p></li>
													<li><p>Percentile values are calculated using data for 1979-2020.</p></li>
													<li><p>Modeled data performs relatively well in estimating precipitation, however, the estimates may differ when compared to weather station-based observations. The differences vary by region and some of these differences are expected from a meteorological perspective. As a result, an area may be described as having higher or lower levels of precipitation than actually occurred.</p></li>
													<li><p>Census tract and county level estimates of precipitation are obtained by processing modeled data, which are available by 1/8th-degree grid. The process of converting grid level data to other geographies using a population-weighted centroid approach may lead to potential misclassification of precipitation for some areas.</p></li>

				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

				<p><b>Derivation of measure</b></p>
				<p><p>North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) data, available at the 1/8th-degree grid (approximately, 14x14 km), consist of 103,936 grid cells that cover the entire United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.</p><p>We convert grid-level data to U.S. Census tract and county level estimates to determine population exposure to extreme precipitation and enable linkage with health datasets. We use a multi-stage geo-imputation approach to convert grid-level precipitation data. We first assign each U.S. Census block centroid to a NLDAS grid cell based on a containment relationship, and estimate block-level estimates of daily total precipitation from hourly grid-level data. Using block-level population as weights, we then calculate a population-weighted average of daily total precipitation by U.S. Census tracts. From this Census tract level data product, we create average county-level estimates of daily total precipitation using tract population as weights.</p><p>We then calculate the 90<sup>th</sup>, 95<sup>th</sup>, 98<sup>th</sup>, and 99<sup>th</sup> percentile values of daily total precipitation. The percentiles are specific to each geography (e.g., Census tract or county) and across for all available years of data. We then identify extreme precipitation days for each combination of the following parameters (1) absolute (e.g., 0.01 inches, 1 inch, 2 inches, and 3 inches) or relative (e.g., 90<sup>th</sup>, 95<sup>th</sup>, 98<sup>th</sup>, and 99<sup>th</sup> percentile values) threshold.</p><p>We also provide monthly average daily total precipitation (in inches) by county.</p></p>
